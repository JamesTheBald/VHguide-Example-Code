                When it comes to pregnant women, you have to give patients as much choice and self-determination as
                possible. To do that, my approach has always been a little less confrontational and I focus on
                validating their concerns. From there, it’s about recognizing that it’s likely going to take a lot of
                work to get some moms on the same page as you. It’s going to take multiple conversations. If you push
                them too much on medical procedures, then some women will completely turn off. So, with pregnant women,
                you have to prioritize having the patient come back, so you can’t risk pushing them away.

                I avoid the ‘presumptive approach’ that a lot of people in healthcare are using. I don’t begin the
                conversation with , "So, hey, so it's time to get your vaccine today." In the pregnancy realm I just
                don’t think the moms or the docs are ready for that to be the go-to method.

                There are pregnant patients who, if you belabor the point about getting the vaccine, or make them feel
                bad about remaining unvaccinated, those patients are going to just shut down. And now you’ve lost the
                capacity to help them through their pregnancy and revisit the vaccine conversation.

                You have to validate their concerns. I know, it can be scary if you’re pregnant and you have these
                free-floating worries about the vaccines’ safety. You have to try to understand why they're so upset.
                That might take several visits. At the initial appointment, if I hear they aren’t interested in getting
                vaccinated, I just make a mental note and say, once we have a relationship and they’re coming back
                regularly, then I’ll return to the conversation.

                I make sure I’m validating their feelings very early in the conversation. I only use the ‘I’m also a
                parent’ tactic very sparingly. Maybe only at the end of a conversation as things are wrapping up. I
                might use it as a closing statement to talk about things based on what I have seen. Mostly I validate
                directly rather than always trying to say ‘I hear you as another parent.’

                The worst thing to do is to break the therapeutic relationship with them. My goal is always to be able
                to have a conversation about vaccination with them in the future. Especially with my pregnant or complex
                patients, when I know that I’m going to be seeing them again. I try to be as non judgmental as possible,
                even though internally that's not what I might be feeling. But I have found that those conversations
                that start from a place of non-judgment are just more successful.

                You have to take the time to find the sources of people’s mistrust. Some pregnant patients have had a
                bad history with vaccines, or just healthcare, in other countries. So they bring a lot of mistrust to
                the conversation. Maybe of the system, or of pharma companies, or of governments. The thing about those
                trust issues is that they can be about the whole system, or about individual relationships and parts.
                This means you can’t treat all mistrust the same way. It could be mistrust about vaccination, or the
                institutions that conduct clinical trials, or the producers of vaccines. It can be a lack of trust in
                the vaccination programs, or a lack of trust of the providers themselves. You’ve got to take the time to
                find out. Especially with pregnant patients.

                A small number of people come to the vaccine conversation saying ‘Forget about it, I won’t talk about
                vaccination’, and they're angry that I brought it up. The rest are just worried. They're anxious. They
                don’t know what to do. And some of them are absolutely thrilled when I bring it up. They say ‘Well, I've
                read a lot about the vaccines – what would you do?’ That’s when I tell them I was first in line when I
                was given the opportunity to get this vaccine. And I wouldn't have changed for one second what I would
                have done if I'd been pregnant or thinking about getting pregnant. And sometimes that's all they need to
                hear.

                Anxiety in the prenatal world is huge, and with the pandemic on top of it, there's even more of it. In
                that context I try to focus on vaccination as an opportunity to help protect their babies. I focus on
                how the vaccine isn’t just about us – it's about this infant, which is at a very high risk, and that
                that tends to be fairly powerful for some pregnant patients.

                Some [partners/family members] can be very aggressive about their stance on vaccination. I have to
                underline that it is the patient’s choice, and often what I’ll do is come back to that patient when
                their [partner/family] is not there with us in the room.
