                  When I have conversations about exemptions, I try to tell people upfront whether what they're asking
                  for is on the table or not. I don't want that expectation building &mdash; it makes for a bigger
                  letdown if the answer is &lsquo;no&rsquo;. If they will not be eligible for the exemption, I try to
                  move very quickly into what I can do for them. I recognize that this is likely not what they want to
                  hear, and then shift the conversation to the things that I can offer for them and their situation.

                  It's an art form. You want to lead early with your decision, because if you avoid it, you go down the
                  justification path. Demanding patients will start to barter every justification you provide to them.
                  The conversation will naturally escalate, and then you're in this back-and-forth of the “no” and “why
                  not”, and then it moves outside of a therapeutic relationship. Now it's a negotiation. Now it's about
                  trying to get a better price on a car.

                  I've had patients who demand the same thing five or more times. By the second time, I've stopped
                  explaining and I just repeat, calmly and politely, what I'm offering again. It can be really
                  frustrating for them to hear, but at least you're not getting into that negotiation space.

                  Getting into debate around facts is probably not helpful and won't be productive. But I think again
                  having a few high-level pieces to share can be useful &mdash; like that all the major religions have
                  come forward and said that it is morally right to get vaccinated. If you just stick to these key
                  facts, it can help direct the conversation. It will always be important to recognize what the patient
                  is saying and acknowledge the information and perspective that they're bringing. But your job is to
                  let them know that this information and perspective, valid as they are, don't change your position on
                  giving them an exemption.

                  So those high-level [facts and statements] that you can pull out can be incredibly helpful. You can
                  just keep repeating these and sticking to your guns. Don't leave a crack in the wall for them to sneak
                  through and start that back-and-forth negotiation or fact-trading. If you get to that point where you
                  are clearly at an impasse, you might have to agree to disagree with that patient, and say &mdash;
                  &lsquo;as your physician, I'm not going to recommend against vaccination&rsquo;.

                  When they ask for an exemption letter, I first try to assess whether they are medically eligible to
                  get the vaccine. I walk them through this and say, &lsquo;There are specific sorts of medical criteria
                  that would exempt people from vaccines. Do you meet any of those?&rsquo; If they don't, I try to
                  explain to them why they aren't then eligible for a medical exemption. I then open a conversation
                  about what's keeping them from getting a vaccine.

                  Many of these patients [requesting exemptions] are people who have to get vaccinated because of job
                  requirements. For some patients, it's a matter of coming up with a medical excuse for a work
                  requirement. Mostly they bring up allergies, or needle fears, but, regardless of what they're saying,
                  the way you reply is about the same. You emphasize what IS and what ISN'T medical about what they're
                  bringing to you. For example, someone says, “I'm suicidal.” you say , "Okay, I can help you with that
                  piece, but I cannot help you with the exemption letter because you're not medically eligible for
                  that."

                  I base these decisions [about exemptions] on my professional standards, because I think the only way
                  that you can sleep at night in any aspect of medicine is to reassure yourself that you've worked in
                  good conscience. I think ultimately you are your harshest critic. Although getting pushback or
                  negative comments from patients is hard, if you can then go back the next day and realize that it was
                  actually the correct thing to do, that's the only way you can mentally cope.

                  I have one patient that thinks her MS flared after her vaccine, and she's really hesitant to get the
                  second dose, so that's actually a really reasonable concern. I'm inviting her to talk this through and
                  asking her to figure out the right timing, and how we can support that timing. It's important to have
                  some mercy, you know. It's a discussion about how bad this flare-up was, and then balancing that with
                  how bad it might be if she weren't fully vaccinated and got COVID.

                  When they ask for an exemption letter, I try to see what's going on. First, I try to assess if they
                  are medically eligible to take the vaccine. If they are, I try to convince them of that fact. It's
                  about talking to them. “Is there any information that I can share that would help you make a decision
                  about getting vaccinated?”

                  So, again I try to explore what it is about getting vaccinated that is upsetting to the patient. I try
                  to discuss the environment and how they can prepare ahead of time to make sure they feel the best they
                  can about getting the vaccine. I think the key is trying to tease out what it is that is making them
                  feel distressed, and talking through solutions that work for them.
