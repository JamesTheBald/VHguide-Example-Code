          I'm totally isolated because I'm not vaccinated. I can't do anything with anybody anymore. I want to be able
          to present an exemption letter because my mental health is in the crapper. Is my mental health not a
          legitimate medical concern?

          I've been your patient for over 10 years - it's not such a big ask really [for an exemption letter]. You say
          &lsquo;oh it's against procedures and stuff&rsquo; but like procedures are procedures and then there's real
          human relationships.
