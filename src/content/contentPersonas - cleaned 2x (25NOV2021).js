Some of those patients are able to receive the vaccine if they jump off the medication before the vaccine. So it is still possible to give the vaccine in certain situations, but there's got to be a gap in the immunosuppressants that you take when you receive the vaccine. You have to kind of reduce the dulling down of the immune system so that the immune system can recognize the thing that's presented in the vaccine. Then you can go back on your medication again. So, I can always investigate the best way forward by having a chat with your specialist and making sure that we're making the right decisions.

One reason we don't want coal mines is because they put selenium into the water at a level that will, even though it's only millionths of a gram, will kill the fish, make people sick, can't use the water, ruin people's wells. So selenium is pretty toxic in those amounts. But here's the funny thing: if you have no selenium, you'll die. That's why you find selenium in multivitamins. It's amount that's key.

You'll never be a good reader if you don't learn it when you're little, because that's when your brain is primed to learn this stuff.

            Fears around needles can be challenging for patients in all aspects of healthcare, including with bloodwork
            and other routine vaccinations. Helping your patient address the source of their anxieties around needles
            (e.g. pain, fainting, etc.) - and exploring various options for the setting and context of vaccination - can
            make the vaccines seem more approachable and acceptable.

          <>
            It is important to consider multiple ways in which people with a fear of needles might have more positive
            experiences when getting the vaccine, such as: not rushing them through the appointment, making your
            immunization room as comfortable and supportive as possible. Spending even an extra 10 minutes with someone
            can be worth it in the long run.
