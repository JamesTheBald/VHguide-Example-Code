        Imagine if the chef from your favorite restaurant could come over to your house and make your favorite dish -
        your favorite food that they make at the restaurant. And they brought that recipe with them. Together, you guys
        cooked in your kitchen and made that recipe. But then when you were done, the chef left and they took the recipe
        with them. They cleaned up, and left your house, only leaving behind your favorite dish. Now, does your house
        look any different?
        <br />
        <br />
        So that’s kind of how this mRNA stuff works. It comes into your cell, which is your house. And it uses a part of
        your house, which is the kitchen. That’s not the brain of your house, the DNA part. And it helps you make the
        protein, which is the dinner. And then your body gets busy learning how to block that protein.
        <br />
        <br />
        And when that’s done the chef and the recipe just go away, they don’t stick around in your cell at all. They
        can’t even get close to the brain of your house. So the chef was never in the den, the bedrooms, or the study.
        They were never close to your home computer with the banking details, or your safe with the family heirlooms.
        They just hung out in your kitchen for a little bit, made some good food and then got out of there. What do you
        think? Does that kind of picture of how the mRNA works? Make a little bit more sense? Make you feel more
        comfortable?

        Okay. So do you remember Ebola and another virus called &mdash; its acronym is MERS, M&ndash;E&ndash;R&ndash;S.
        We love our acronyms in science. But, researchers were actually looking at mRNA technology to fight those two
        conditions. And then things died out with that. They put that mRNA technology on the shelf. And vaccine science
        is kind of tricky because you have to have enough people sick with [a disease] in order to study
        [the vaccines].
        <br />
        <br />
        So when COVID started up, the scientists pulled the mRNA off the shelf and said, &lsquo;
        <i>Hey, let&apos;s see what we can do with this.</i>&rsquo; And instead of asking one question, then
        researching, then asking another question, researching &mdash; we were able to ask a whole bunch of questions at
        the same time, because so much funding got thrown at this.
        <br />
        <br />
        And as the information was coming out, it could be reviewed by groups like Health Canada and the FDA at the same
        time. So we removed all of those really slow wait times. Whenever information for these vaccines came to Health
        Canada, they stopped everything else they were doing to look at it. It&apos;s like when you&apos;re at
        Disneyland and you get a FastPass to get on a ride immediately, so you don&apos;t have to wait in line behind
        everyone else.
        <br />
        <br />
        Also &mdash; we started producing vaccine in the factory before we even knew for sure it was going to work. And
        so as soon as we knew it was going to work, we could start giving the [vaccines] out. Whereas
        usually we&apos;d have to wait a year or two for them to make the vaccine.
        <br />
        <br />
        So it&apos;s not about any corners being cut. It&apos;s really more about we just understood that we needed to
        not slow this down in any way with regulatory waiting times. We didn&apos;t remove the red tape. We just got
        some sharper scissors to get through the red tape as we need to. I like to think that we&apos;ve learned a lot
        from this and [we should] maybe think about how we need to approve things moving forward and not
        have it be so darn slow.

        The reason they were able to go faster, is that they&apos;ve invested more than they&apos;ve ever invested
        before. And they worked together in ways that they&apos;ve never done before. And it turns out a lot of the
        ideas and parts they needed to build the vaccine were ready and waiting for them. All that work had
        already been done. So they had a running start and they had vast sums of money and time.
        <br />
        <br />
        It actually makes me kind of angry that they could do what they did with this vaccine [e.g. developing
        them so quickly, distributing globally], but they haven&apos;t done the same thing for TB? Why don&apos;t
        they do this for malaria? Now, that we know this is possible, I want to see them do it for all sorts of
        conditions that are killing people who are under-resourced. But as far as these vaccines go, I don&apos;t
        necessarily need you to trust them, but I do think you should trust me. These are good vaccines. They stop
        people from dying from the virus.

    text: (

        What&apos;s really cool about these mRNA vaccines that makes them even better than other vaccines is that they
        go into your cell and they make your cell produce those little spiky things that you see in all the COVID
        pictures. Those spikes are how COVID attaches onto your cells in your body and how it starts attacking you. So,
        instead of having COVID attack you, and take over your cells, the mRNA from the vaccine goes inside your cell,
        and it tells your cell to create just that same little spiky thing. None of the virus itself, just the little
        spiky thing. And then your body&apos;s like, &apos;Oh, what&apos;s this spiky thing? This looks bad,&apos; and
        it starts to develop an immune response. <br /> <br />
        Your immune system attacks this little spiky protein things and learns to repel them. While your immune system
        is doing all this, back inside the cell the mRNA from the vaccine is already being broken down and destroyed by
        your cells. Unlike a virus, it can&apos;t take over your cells. It&apos;s just a recipe book for spiky proteins.
        It can&apos;t interact with or touch your DNA. So it&apos;s a one-way street for RNA. It&apos;s gone straight
        afterwards. It&apos;s not getting into your DNA.

        The side effects are actually a sign that your immune system has caught on and is fired up. So that&apos;s not
        saying something&apos;s wrong with the vaccine. That&apos;s actually saying it&apos;s doing its job. Now, the
        reason there&apos;s a few blood clots is because for a few people, a very few, your immune system produces sort
        of a weird antibody. Everybody produces different antibodies, slightly different. <br />
        <br />
        If we all produced exactly the same antibody, we would have all died a long time ago because the bacteria and
        viruses and parasites that affect us would have like only one antibody to deal with. They would evolve to adapt
        to it. They would be on to us and we be toast. But because we are all different, there can&apos;t be one
        strategy that bugs use that&apos;ll get us all. So, once in a while, one person out of a million &mdash;
        literally one out of a million &mdash; produces an antibody that isn&apos;t good for them. And it&apos;s
        basically, it&apos;s an autoimmune disease. And that&apos;s what the blood clot problem was. And that&apos;s the
        same thing as with lupus or with rheumatoid arthritis, or even when something is as pedestrian as psoriasis.
        That&apos;s when your immune system produces an antibody that attacks your own skin, which is off course. And
        that&apos;s a real risk. It happens. It doesn&apos;t just happen only with vaccines.
