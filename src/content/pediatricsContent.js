                  still going on the teams are collecting lots of data. Now, the initial results we&apos;ve seen have

                  I hear you about the lack of long-term data on side effects. And that can give you pause. If
                  you&apos;re thinking along those lines, then you&apos;ll also want to consider the other long-term
                  data that we don&apos;t have. We <strong>don&apos;t</strong> know what happens to the development of a
                  kid who&apos;s had COVID. What are the developmental effects of getting the disease, unvaccinated? We
                  know that we&apos;ve got long-haulers &mdash; people who just can&apos;t get over COVID. They&apos;ve
                  got headaches and focus problems and all that &mdash; how does THAT affect development? We also know
                  that people who&apos;ve had COVID are more prone to blood clots and strokes and that sort of thing. We
                  know about those risks, but the bottom line is that, just like we don&apos;t know about the long-term
                  effects of being vaccinated, we can&apos;t say what the long-term effects of getting COVID are on a
                  young body. It&apos;s a balance you&apos;ve got to strike, but for me it comes back to being safer in
                  the moment.

                  We vaccinate children for more than a dozen diseases routinely. For more than a century we&apos;ve
                  been doing it, and for more than a century the health of the whole population has gotten steadily
                  better. Now, not every disease we vaccinate kids for is immediately life threatening. So, just because

                  The vaccine component only stays in the body for a relatively short period of time. So if you&apos;re

                  In terms of fertility, if we look at how these vaccines work and how long the actual vaccine and its

                  lymph nodes for roughly seven days. The spike protein that your body makes from this vaccine stays
                  only for a few weeks, and it&apos;s out of your system. I hear you, that there is so much
                  misinformation saying that these vaccines are going to stay in your system for years and they may

                  I think we have to ask ourselves: is COVID-19 an important disease in children? I think the answer to
                  that is an emphatic &lsquo;yes!&rsquo; We know that children are at lower risk of severe outcomes than
                  adults so I don&apos;t want to oversell it. But kids are getting severe COVID-19 and passing away from
                  this disease in many settings. So children are at lower risk, but not at no risk.

                  Unfortunately, here in North America, we have just gone through another massive wave. That wave has
                  quite significantly increased the chances your kid(s) have been exposed to COVID in the community. For
                  me, it&apos;s safe to say at this point in time that it&apos;s not an &lsquo;if&rsquo;, it&apos;s a
                  &lsquo;when&rsquo; an unvaccinated child will get COVID. For me that ups the ante. If they&apos;re

                  all means we should be vaccinating children.

                  I&apos;ve heard the data that 99% or so of kids are just fine, but some of the kids aren&apos;t fine.
                  These are kids who were otherwise healthy but are ending up in the hospital, or have long COVID (or
                  MIS-C) and are unwell for weeks or months. I don&apos;t want that being my kid and I don&apos;t want
                  it to be your kid either. We can get there. With the vaccine its totally preventable.

                  I think that you need to consider familial protection as well. Kids have a big impact on family. A
                  child who&apos;s not vaccinated could bring COVID into the house, could even bring it into
                  grandma&apos;s house.

                  You know how kids are at school right, wearing each other&apos;s clothes and wiping snot on their
                  sleeve, and then swapping sweaters and all that good stuff. Kids are great spreaders of disease, and I
                  also feel so sorry for the school teachers who have had to deal with so many outbreaks. The vaccine is
                  there to help out with that.

                  I think at the beginning of the pandemic, a lot of the communication that went out said: &lsquo;COVID
                  is not a problem for kids, it&apos;s a problem for older people&rsquo;. I think that this statement
                  has turned out not to be true, especially with the Delta variant. My colleagues from pediatrics keep
                  telling me how, within the last few months (late 2021), there are so many more kids coming to the
                  hospital sick with COVID. I understand that we are seeing some children die from COVID-19. Is the risk
                  of dying from COVID-19 higher for an 80-year-old? Yes. On the other hand, as a parent, you can argue
                  that one child death from something that is preventable is one too many.

                  COVID-19 compared to the number of kids that have died from other diseases that we vaccinate for. We
                  vaccinate for measles, right? Remember, when [your children] were 18 months old, they got their
                  measles vaccine, the MMR, and chicken pox, right? When we look at the numbers for bad stuff happening
                  with COVID-19 infection compared to other things we already vaccinate our kids for, COVID-19 is the
                  most serious of all.

                  I know that a lot of people are uncomfortable about giving the vaccine to their kids. I get it. I
                  totally empathize. I think it&apos;s also worthwhile considering the risks that unvaccinated kids pose
                  to grandparents or older relatives. The risks they present to people in your family who are unwell or
                  have other conditions. If your kids remain unvaccinated, you will have to constantly ask yourself,
                  &lsquo;is it worth the risk of seeing them?&rsquo;.

                  I guess in all this we&apos;re trying to find a balance between the benefits of the vaccines in
                  protecting our kids, and the potential risk of side effects. Finding that balance, for me, is about
                  looking at both how likely is it for your kid to get COVID, AND how likely they&apos;re going to be to
                  pass it onto others. Kids are good spreaders of this disease and that&apos;s why we&apos;re focusing
                  on them at this stage of the game.

                  I&apos;m totally happy to talk about this again. I just want to leave something with you, and
                  it&apos;s the idea that there are no risk-free choices. By choosing not to be vaccinated or to get
                  vaccinated at this point, there are risks that come with both choices. And regardless of how we feel,
                  at the end of the day, whatever we choose to do, no choice in our life is risk free.

                  risks for complications.

                  With the vaccine, we give kids a controlled exposure so that their bodies develop the appropriate
                  immunity. That way when they get exposed to a larger dose of COVID or the next variant &mdash; a
                  variant which may affect kids&apos; hearts much, much worse than Delta, then they&apos;ve got some
                  level of protection there, just like we do for many flu viruses.

                  I don&apos;t have small children now, but I had them once upon a time. Did I worry when my 17-year-old
                  son went for his vaccination? Yes! I&apos;d just spent a week reviewing all the data that was coming
                  out, and what it said was that this boy of mine was the perfect person to get myocarditis from mRNA

                  to 11?&rsquo;. You know what? I think we know enough. We know that it was tested in 3000 kids that
                  they followed for 12 weeks. Every serious side effect that happens in vaccine studies throughout
                  history comes up within six weeks. The side effects we have seen in kids of this age are fewer than
                  the side effects that older kids get, and the serious side effects have not been seen in the five to
                  nine age group.
