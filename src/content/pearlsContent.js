                A key first step really is to hear &mdash; really hear &mdash; their concern and be able to say &lsquo;
                <i>That sounds like a reasonable concern.</i>&rsquo; Right? If you can say that, all of a sudden
                you&apos;re allied with the patient. So you ask the open question, then you reflect back and affirm
                their point of view, telling them, &lsquo;<i>Yeah, that&apos;s a reasonable concern.</i>&rsquo;

                For a Motivational Interview to work, the first step is to ask those open questions. And no matter what
                the answers are, you have to be able to reflect back and affirm what they say. If you can&apos;t do
                that, then you&apos;re not on their side. You&apos;re just another person who is in their out-group.
                Another person who doesn&apos;t get how their world works.

                You never really know anyone else&apos;s experiences or traumas. Knowing this, it&apos;s best to
                approach conversations as doors that can be opened or shut. If you say something to shut a door &mdash;
                call people&apos;s experiences or perspectives out as uninformed or silly &mdash; there&apos;s the good
                chance that the door never opens again. It can be so hard, but affirming experiences and perspectives
                &mdash; even when they conflict with your own &mdash; is the way to keep doors open. You might not have
                a &lsquo;yes&rsquo; to vaccination today, but you can&apos;t get closer to your patient thinking about
                it in a positive light if you shut the door.

                athletic, and only 40, and how when he got COVID it laid him low. I tell them how he&apos;s been having

                We know from the risk communication literature that many people have trouble making statistics apply to

                from some very, very rare events. 1 in 100,000 events. So, one person out of 100,000 gets a blood clot.
                I compare that to their chances of dying in a traffic accident &mdash; which is a chance we take every
                time we get in a car &mdash; that chance is 1 in 20,000. I find grounding it like that helps.
