                  Even for highly educated parents, often they're just really anxious. You&apos;ve got to get to, and
                  address, that emotion. I tell them my children are vaccinated and that I was anxious too. Sometimes
                  that's all they need to hear, you know? We&apos;re all torn in a million different directions. Meeting
                  someone there is important.

                  Don&apos;t get drawn into the Information Deficit Game! Yes, a lot of the time the conversation just
                  is centered on information: safety studies say this, and epidemiologists say that. But remember, under
                  all that the hesitancy probably isn&apos;t rooted in information. Your whole conversation is about
                  establishing trust.

                  Offering them certainty seems like a great option, but joining them in uncertainty is probably more
                  effective. To do that you need to acknowledge that you can only give the best advice on what you know
                  today. And that might be totally different from what you know tomorrow. We&apos;ve all been through
                  the “Mask, no mask; Only certain kinds of masks; Cloth masks are okay; Or maybe not”. When we&apos;ve
                  all been through that, validating that things are uncertain - and focusing on the best knowledge we
                  have now, can be a helpful way forward.

                  As someone who practices medicine, you have to deal with changing evidence and changing
                  recommendations. And it&apos;s really hard, really humbling, to convey to a patient that there is no
                  absolute truth. It seems counterintuitive, but conveying that uncertainty, admitting to it, is
                  actually the key to building trust. Showing that you&apos;re in it with them and that you&apos;re
                  bringing your expertise to their side.

                  Often my patients will know that I have kids as well and will ask if they&apos;ve been vaccinated. I
                  find that talking about some of these personal choices our family has made can help cut through some
                  of the misinformation. I don't often volunteer that information, but for patients I've known for a
                  long time, or if they ask the question, I'll share with them.

                  Let&apos;s face it, the official guidance on the vaccines is not reassuring. It&apos;s ambiguous. It
                  says: &lsquo;You should talk to your doctor and see if it&apos;s right for you or your kid(s).&rsquo;
                  But what does that mean? I think that's the sticking point for a lot of people. From my perspective,
                  it's right for everybody. They should all get their vaccine. So I work really hard to make it clear
                  why vaccination is important, even for kids. I go over all of the risks and benefits.

                  The complacency thing is the biggest challenge when it comes to kids. I think there&apos;s this
                  widespread belief that it&apos;s just no big deal for them. We&apos;ve got to nail that. And it&apos;s
                  a different conversation than talking about confidence in the safety of the vaccine. That&apos;s big
                  too, but it&apos;s a different conversation.

                  I like to recognize that we have all pretty much hit a wall, when it comes to our kid(s) and
                  restrictions. I know people are having pizza parties, holiday parties, and both unvaccinated and
                  vaccinated kids are coming. It&apos;s important to have empathy and accept that people are tired, and
                  life needs to go on, for us and our kids.

                  Dealing with strong emotions, accusations even, from patients is hard, right? For me it's impossible
                  not to take it personally, so I have to try to breathe three or four times. Be aware that my hands are
                  sweating, and my heart is going at 150 beats a minute. And from there I can get back to compassion.
                  Most of the time when people react with anger, it's because they're hurting. Right? They're hurting or
                  afraid. Something hurts so much or scares them so much that they can only lash out. Knowing that, I
                  try to come from a place of compassion and that's what helps me to defuse my own feelings of being
                  attacked or undermined. I just try to say,{" "}

                  I can see the dynamic of an 11-year-old who wants to vaccinate, and parents who don't, being quite a
                  tricky one to handle. I think that's one of those situations that's a conversation over time. If
                  you've got the capacity, you should support that conversation. You make sure that the parents are not
                  just thinking about &lsquo;yes&rsquo; versus &lsquo;no&rsquo;. Instead you are focusing on their
                  rationale; their worries; their sense of the benefits; their role in making decisions for their kids.
                  You will probably have to come back at least twice to the conversation: once with just the parents,
                  and then a follow up with both parents and kid(s).
