            , our team developed the &lsquo;EAASE&rsquo; steps to help guide conversations with vaccine hesitant
            patients: Engage, Affirm, Ask then Share, and Evoke. We call them steps, but you don&apos;t need to follow
            them as a sequence. You can begin and end on any step.

          The EAASE approach improves conversations by focusing on the trust relationship between you and your patient.
          Rather than focusing on getting your patient to say &lsquo;yes&rsquo; to vaccination, the first aim of an
          EAASE conversation is to build an alliance and set a foundation for vaccine confidence.

            </a>
            about vaccination with your patients. Asking open questions can help demonstrate your interest, and create a
            safe space for them to share real concerns.

              <strong>Affirm</strong> and reflectively listen:
            </span>
            <span>Affirm your patientâ€™s worldview, and situate yourself as an ally. You can do this by:</span>
            <ul className="pt-3 listClass">
              <li>
                Emphasizing your patient&apos;s autonomy &mdash; they will be a good person regardless of the decision
                they make.
              </li>
              <li>Offering to work together as equals to understand available vaccine information.</li>
              <li>Emphasizing the importance of individual decisions for protection of the broader community.</li>
              <li>
                Ensuring they feel heard. A patient who feels misheard and mis-interpreted is unlikely to trust you.
                Reflective listening is important in overcoming gaps in our understandings of others.

              <strong>Ask</strong> for permission, then <strong>Share</strong> information:
            </span>
            <span>
              Check that you understand where your patient is coming from, then ask permission to share your knowledge
              and perspectives. This places the two of you on the same team, with a shared goal of protecting them
              and&#47;or their community.

                Encourage patients to imagine different outcomes or scenarios based on their choice to either vaccinate
                or remain unvaccinated.

            Ironically, EAASE conversations can often be difficult to have. Remember: the goal is to support your
            patient&apos;s decision-making, rather than convincing them to get a vaccine.
