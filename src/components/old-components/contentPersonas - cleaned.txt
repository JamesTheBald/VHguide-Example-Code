                    an airplane crash. Even though it happens incredibly rarely, the media make sure you know about it.
                    It’s been like this with the vaccine ever since it was approved. Everybody's very interested,
                    rightfully so, in how things go, every little twist and turn. It all gets reported on. But all the
                    reporting on very rare events, combined with us being cooped up, all that makes people anxious. So

                    agencies or something to talk about safety. It might be worthwhile thinking about that.

                    What's really cool about these mRNA vaccines that makes them even better than other vaccines is
                    that they go into your cell and they make your cell produce those little spiky things that you see

                    it starts attacking you. So, instead of having COVID attack you, and take over your cells, the mRNA
                    from the vaccine goes inside your cell, and it tells your cell to create just that same little spiky
                    thing. None of the virus itself, just the little spiky thing. And then your body's like,
                    ‘
                    <i>Oh, what's this spiky thing? This looks bad</i>’, and it starts to develop an immune

                    So, I've been reading letters from specialists caring for patients who are on medications to
                    change the way that their immune system works. Some of those patients are able to receive the
                    vaccine if they jump off the medication before the vaccine. So it is still possible to give the
                    vaccine in certain situations, but there's got to be a gap in the immunosuppressants that you
                    take when you receive the vaccine. You have to kind of reduce the dulling down of the immune system
                    so that the immune system can recognize the thing that's presented in the vaccine. Then you can
                    go back on your medication again. So, I can always investigate the best way forward by having a chat
                    with your specialist and making sure that we're making the right decisions.

                    I guess when it comes to COVID, my major concern is when you've got someone with the medical
                    problems you have, I really worry that you would get a really bad run of it if you caught the virus.
                    You would be a very high risk for winding up in hospital, doing really badly, maybe even needing the
                    ICU. People that have been into ICU, they don't come out in great shape if they do come out.
                    I'd rather we just protect you from that altogether. These vaccines do that.

                    It's been standard practice to vaccinate moms-to-be for the flu, and whooping cough as well.
                    The idea is that the mom can pass along her protection to the newborn. And so we think the rationale
                    is really similar for COVID. What we see in the research is that the vaccine itself does not cross
                    the placenta. So the baby is not affected by the vaccine, but mom can give her protection to the
                    baby. So mom is doing this incredible thing for the baby, which is using her immune system to
                    protect the newborn. And I can't imagine any sort of mom-to-be who wouldn't want to hand

                    took a vaccine. They need Viagra because they have other problems. Maybe they have high blood

                    Can I personally vouch for every CEO of every Big Pharma company? Can I personally vouch that no one
                    in history has ever done something shady to try and make money? Absolutely I can't. And yet in
                    my work, every single day I see people's whose lives are changed for the better, as a result of
                    drug therapies developed by pharmaceutical companies. I see people who live longer, fuller lives
                    because we're able to use the medications that are out there. And the vaccine is one of those
                    drugs — longer, fuller lives for all of us. Better lives. Lives without masks and distancing
                    and restrictions.

                    I get to see lots of people, lots of different experiences, and have a different perspective than

                    You're exactly right. The problem is that a small percentage of a large number of people piles

                    and of those, probably about 30% of them die.

                    I see what you're saying. Well, if I was going to put my evil thinking cap on, if I was trying
                    to create a situation where absolutely everyone would want to get a vaccine, I wouldn't give
                    them something similar to what we've seen before, like the flu. I'd go big. I'd be
                    like, ‘
                    <i>Okay, Im going to create something that's going to make everyone's skin turn purple</i>
                    ’, and the only way to fix it is by taking a vaccine. Because no one wants to walk around
                    looking purple and it would be really visible. I also wouldn’t have the disease kill anyone because
                    you can't sell a vaccine to someone who is already dead. So I guess if that was their
                    [e.g., pharmaceutical companies'/the government's] real objective, they maybe
                    didn't come up with the right disease.

                    thinking is wrong, but I'm just giving you another way to think about them. A vaccine is a
                    teacher. Your immune system is one of the most amazing learning machines in the known universe. The
                    vaccine just stands in front of your genius immune system and shows it a piece of the virus, and
                    says: ‘
                    <i>Hey, this is the bad stuff. This is what you want to attack.</i>’ And off your immune

                    Can I give you another way to think about the vaccines? The vaccine is like a cop — a homicide

                    dog to sniff. Your immune system is that attack dog. The vaccine goes in and waves the
                    suspect's glove in front of the attack dog. It's like the vaccine is saying: ‘
                    <i>This is what you're after.</i>’ And once your immune system has that scent, it's
                    on a mission!

                    <i>Amount</i> is the key word with anything you're putting in your body. Now, there are some
                    things that are so poisonous that any amount is the wrong amount. Plutonium [which is
                    radioactive] is so toxic that even the tiniest amount will make you sick. Let me give you
                    another example of selenium. One reason we don't want coal mines is because they put selenium
                    into the water at a level that will, even though it's only millionths of a gram, will kill the
                    fish, make people sick, can't use the water, ruin people's wells. So selenium is pretty
                    toxic in those amounts. But here's the funny thing: if you have no selenium, you'll die.
                    That's why you find selenium in multivitamins. It's amount that's key.

                    So your immune system is kind of like your language system. If you don't learn a language, if
                    you don't learn to read when you're young, you can do it when you're older, but
                    you're never good at it. You'll never be a native speaker. You'll never be a good
                    reader if you don't learn it when you're little, because that's when your brain is
                    primed to learn this stuff. And when you're young is when your immune system is primed to learn
                    this stuff too. Now that's not great news for people like me in our sixties who are getting the
                    vaccine. And that's why if you read this stuff, you'll see people my age just don't
                    develop the immune response. We get some, but we just don't develop the immune response that
                    younger people do because we're too far past that, what we call it, a critical period.
                    That's what the language teachers talk about. We're too far past that. I mean, I could
                    learn Mandarin. I've learned a few words, but I'll never be an actual Mandarin speaker. If
                    I'd started when I was 10. I could have been. And your immune system works that way. It's

                    when you get appendicitis to let it explode and potentially get in big trouble from that. It's
                    arguably unnatural to have a surgeon cut it out. But for sure you would want that. And I think
                    there's other kinds of medical inventions that you would want to take advantage of if you

                    ICU. Whether that's your friends, or your family members. Do you absolutely need this vaccine?
                    Maybe not, maybe it'd be fine. But do we as a community need this vaccine? I think we do. The
                    vaccine helps stop the transmission chains and gets us back to normal, natural life.

                    You're right, you could look at the people getting the vaccine as sheep. Just following what
                    the government is saying. But in this case I'm not the government, I'm telling you that
                    this is a really good idea. But you could still just see everyone who's doing it as a sheep.
                    That's fair. My follow up question would be: Who are the group that's not getting the
                    vaccines following? Aren't they just sheep of a different colour? We all have to put some faith
                    in things, I get it. And I'm offering you some perspectives that you can put some faith in.
                    I'm your doctor, not the government. You don't have to put any stock in what I say, but
                    I'm hoping you'll consider it alongside the other ideas you're following.

                    [social activities], and getting the kids back to school, and getting normal again, then
                    it's time. Then it's time for you to say, ‘<i>Okay, I see the benefit here</i>

                    I'm not. This is about you and me finding the best things for your health, and the health of
                    your family. I've been doing research — for everyone like you in my practice — and
                    that research is telling me that these vaccines aren't just safe, they are so much safer than
                    running the risk of not taking them. Choosing to vaccinate gives you power over the system. It lets

                    I've been doing quite a lot of reading and research myself about these vaccines and the
                    different options that might be available to you. Do you think it might be okay if I tell you a

                    For me, getting the vaccine wasn't so much about me, as it was about you. I got vaccinated so I
                    could be here for you. I took it so I can be safe when I'm around you. And I think maybe
                    it's a bit like that in your community too. You might be a bit on the 'maybe' side,
                    but when it is about protecting the community — protecting the Elders and their knowledge.
                    When it comes to that, you're really taking it for them. So you can be there for them.

                    From my point of view, I totally understand there is a mistrust with the system. The health system
                    hasn't exactly been known to put the health and interests of Indigenous people first over the
                    last couple centuries. But I know that not only do the vaccines keep me safe, they also keep my
                    community and my Elders safe. I have a Cree Elder who I know well and she has been vaccinated. I
                    struggled with my own questions about the vaccine but have chosen to do it, and my Métis
                    Grandmother in Manitoba got hers 3 weeks ago. I feel that colonization has taken enough away from
                    us, that I can't risk not doing my part to preserve the culture and knowledge we have left with
                    our Elders especially.

                    With the vaccine rollout, part of it is trying to acknowledge those historical injustices and to
                    provide something that's more equitable. So, one of the reasons Indigenous communities are
                    being prioritized for the vaccine is to move us towards that more just place. You could see it as
                    being at the front of a weird line, I guess, but I can tell you that I've got non-Indigenous
                    patients desperate to get their shots, and so it's a line that lots of people want to be at the
                    front of. For me, the way things are rolling out is a real, good faith effort to improve equity and
                    right some of those historical wrongs.

                    So, the vaccine priority list isn't just about who's most at risk – which people in your
                    community are. It's also about making decisions that help address historical damage and address
                    inequalities. Public health people are thinking about those factors too when they make up the
                    priority lists.

            Fears around needles can be challenging for patients in all aspects of healthcare, including with bloodwork
            and other routine vaccinations. Helping your patient address the source of their anxieties around needles
            (e.g. pain, fainting, etc.) — and exploring various options for the setting and context of
            vaccination — can make the vaccines seem more approachable and acceptable.

                    I get to see lots of people, lots of different experiences, and have a lot more of that bigger
                    picture than the average person who just knows the people in their family and immediate social
                    groups. What I know is that lots and lots of people get sick [with COVID], and a small
                    percentage of people get very, very sick. You're exactly right. The problem is that a small
                    percentage of a large number of people starts to pile up, and every case that ends up in the
                    intensive care unit stays there for three weeks, on average, and of those, probably about 30% of
                    them die. Even later in the pandemic, we have been seeing younger people going to the ICUs. They
                    were all healthy enough that they would otherwise be living normal lives and productive lives.

                    The bottom line is that I know there's lots of confusion, there's lots of different
                    messaging, and there are people out there that are saying completely opposite things from me, and
                    they're saying that this is a natural thing that should be allowed to run its course.
                    What'll happen? Just look at [e.g. <i>early 2021: Ontario, Quebec, India</i>] their
                    intensive care units were full. So, this is just different. This is different because this thing is
                    way more infectious. There's no immunity in the population, so it spreads like wildfire, and
                    these guys that are saying that we need natural immunity, the problem with that is that there's
                    just massive numbers of people that are going to be sick and fill intensive care units. What do you
                    say we do then?

                    From what I saw in the countries that took the approach of what you probably loosely refer to as
                    ‘herd immunity’, the initial thought when this all started was, if we let people get it,
                    then eventually we'll have enough immunity in the population to deal with this and it will run
                    its course. In the fullness of time, this turned out to be the wrong approach. What they [e.g.
                    politicians] weren't aware of was that COVID is a disease that can affect many different
                    people in many different ways. Getting to herd immunity without the vaccines is going to cost a lot
                    of lives and make a lot of people very sick. [

                    So, natural immunity assumes that a lot of people will get sick. A lot of them, you're right,
                    it'll be a sniffle and the flu. But 30% of them will go to hospital. We know that for sure. Do
                    we have space for them in hospital? Are we okay with a portion of them dying? I guess you could say
                    that rolling the dice with natural immunity gets us to the same point as the vaccines. But without
                    the vaccines we get there a lot more slowly.That's extra time waiting for people to die, and
                    working from home, and our kids out of school. Which, for me, isn't the kind of waiting game

                    The reason why this virus is so deadly is because we haven't seen it before. It's like

                    and you've been concerned, the first time it happens is pretty devastating. Right? It's

                    how to respond and you can lose everything. But with the vaccine, that's like installing the
                    full alarm system package and having the security company come and test it. Your body retains a
                    memory of what it saw. So if the real burglars show up, you're ready. And you didn't have
                    to lose everything. Just a sore arm, maybe.

                    very high risk for winding up in hospital, doing really badly, maybe even needing the ICU. People
                    that have been into ICU, they don't come out in great shape if they do come out. I'd
                    rather we just protect you from that altogether. These vaccines do that.

                    Whether that's your mom, or your dad, maybe a grandparent. Do you absolutely need this vaccine?
                    Maybe not, maybe it'd be fine. But do we as a community need this vaccine? I think we do. It
                    stops the transmission chains and gets us safely back to normal.
